# 99 Bottles of Beer

*Excerpt from Sandi Metz' 99 Bottles of OOP*

> It turns out that everything you need to know about Object-Oriented Design (OOD) can be learned from the ["99 Bottles of Beer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer) song. <br/><br/> 
Well, perhaps not everything, but quite certainly a great many things. <br/><br/>
The song is simultaneously easy to understand and full of hidden complexity, which makes it the perfect skeleton upon which to hang lessons in OOD.

## Getting the excercise

1. Make sure you have python installed
2. Clone this repo and you're set!

The directory structure for the excercise should look like this:

```
+-- src
|   +-- bottles.py
|   +-- test_bottles.py

```

## Doing the excercise

To run the test suite, run `python src/test_bottles.py`.

The test suite contains one failing test, and many skipped tests. Your goal is to write code that passes all of the tests. Follow this protocol:

- run the tests and examine the failure
- write only enough code to pass the failing test
- unskip the next test (this simulates writing it yourself)

Repeat the above until no tests is skipped, and you’ve written code to pass each one.

Work on this task for 30 minutes. The vast majority of folks do not finish in 30 minutes, but it’s useful, for later comparison purposes, to record how far you got. Even if you can’t force yourself to stop at that point, take a break at 30 minutes and save your code.
