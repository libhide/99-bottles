# 99 Bottles of Beer

*Excerpt from Sandi Metz' 99 Bottles of OOP*

> It turns out that everything you need to know about Object-Oriented Design (OOD) can be learned from the ["99 Bottles of Beer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer) song. <br/><br/> 
Well, perhaps not everything, but quite certainly a great many things. <br/><br/>
The song is simultaneously easy to understand and full of hidden complexity, which makes it the perfect skeleton upon which to hang lessons in OOD.
